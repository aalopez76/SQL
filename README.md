# SQL Queries: From Fundamental to Advanced

This project focuses on building a dashboard to gain a comprehensive overview of the "Toys and Models" business. The main objective is to identify trends, areas of opportunity, and operational issues. The database contains detailed information about employees, products, orders, customers, and their payments.

The database schema is as follows:

Our goal is to extract the necessary data, starting with fundamental questions and then moving towards a deeper, more strategic analysis.


- **Database Connection**: Implement a modular, Object-Oriented (OOP) connection layer that supports multiple database engines (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite). This approach allows flexible and reusable interaction with different data sources. The class definitions and credential configuration can be reviewed in the repositoryâ€™s connection module.
